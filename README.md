# Networkx
This was one of my problem sets about the library networkx in ptython. This library is used to work with graphs that is used in network science.

This is a jupyter notebook, so in order to run this code you need to open it in google collab or jupyter notebook.

In this code I have used the following libraries:
```networkx```, ```pandas``` and ```numpy```
