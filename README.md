# Networkx
This was one of my problem sets about the library networkx in ptython. This library is used to work with graphs that is used in network science.

This is a jupyter notebook, so in order to run this code you need to open it in google collab or jupyter notebook.

In this code I have used the following libraries:

```networkx```, ```pandas``` and ```numpy```


You can easily install thesse libraries by the following command:

```pip install [name of the library]```

I hope you can use these examples to get familiar with networkx library.
