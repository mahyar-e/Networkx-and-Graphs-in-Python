# Networkx and Graphs in Python
This was one of my problem sets about the library networkx in ptython. This library is used to work with graphs that is used in network science.

This is a jupyter notebook, so in order to run this code you need to open it in google collab or jupyter notebook.

In this code I have used the following libraries:

```networkx```, ```pandas``` and ```numpy```


You can easily install thesse libraries by the following command:

```pip install [name of the library]```

I hope you can use these examples to get familiar with networkx library.
